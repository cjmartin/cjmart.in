<h1>Hi, I'm Chris</h1>
<p>
    I'm a <a href="#dad" data-image="family.jpg" data-flickr-id="53132909387">dad</a>, a software engineer, a <a href="#ski" data-image="ski.jpg" data-flickr-id="54223658892">ski</a>, <a href="#mtb" data-image="mtb.jpg" data-flickr-id="53998019726">mountain bike</a>, soccer, and robotics team coach, 
    the former Head of Platform (and many other things) at Flickr, a co-founder of multiple startups, 
    a builder, a writer, a wanderer, and a curiosity chaser.

<p>
    I live in Truckee with my amazing wife Lauren, who loves me even though I look like a <a href="#horse" data-image="horse.jpg">horse</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not currently looking for full-time roles, but I'm always interested in working on interesting projects with nice people. 
    If you're looking for help with something, you should get in touch!
